			<h2>Patent That Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>Green Mountain Apps, LLC (“GMA”) has created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate its commitment to fully disclosing the information collection and use practices applicable to the Patent-That.com website (the “Site”) and the Patent That application (the “App”) (collectively, the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by GMA through the Services, including any social media platform employed by GMA.  You should consult the privacy policy of any third party sites you access as part of the Services so as to understand the treatment and practices of information you submit via those sites.
By accessing any of the Services, you signify your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not cease using the Services immediately.</h3></p>
<p>
<h3>1. Types of Information and Method of Collection</h3>
</p>
<p>
<h3>General Information Collection</h3>
</p>
<p>
By Browsing. As you browse the Site or use the App the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, “cookies” (described below) and other standard tracking data GMA uses to evaluate traffic and usage patterns are collected. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all visitors. If you only browse the Site you are not required to identify yourself or provide any personally identifiable information. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “Personally Identifiable Information” refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains.
By User’s Voluntary Submission. When using any feature of the Services that allow for unilateral or multilateral communication between yourself and other users of the Services, you may choose to provide other Personally Identifiable information. If you post Personally Identifiable Information anywhere on the Services, it will be available to third parties and you may receive unsolicited messages from those parties. GMA has no obligation to ensure the security or confidentiality of any information you choose to make through the Services that allow for unilateral or multilateral communication between yourself and other users of the Services. Also, GMA cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personally Identifiable Information.
The Services may use a feature of your browser to set “cookies” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information sent by the Services through your browser to your computer. These cookies can be deleted or modified through your browser Internet settings. If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can turn off the cookie acceptance option in your browser’s settings. You may modify your browser preferences to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies you may not be able to utilize fully all of the Services’s features and information.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Information on Children</h3>
</p>
<p>
GMA does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 14.  The Services are intended for use by persons to access information related to patent applications and to capture and expound upon innovations. If GMA learns that it has Personally Identifiable Information on a child under the age of 14, GMA will delete that information from its systems. GMA encourages parents and guardians to monitor children’s computer usage. Parental control protections, such as computing device hardware, software or filtering services, are commercially available to limit the access to material that is harmful to minors.
Confidential/Proprietary Information.
</p>
<p>
The Services are designed to allow users to input and store their confidential/proprietary information. GMA’s obligations regarding your confidential/proprietary information are found here: Non-Disclosure Policy.
</p>
<p>
<h3>2. How Information Collected is Used</h3>
</p>
<p>
Subject to any terms of use that govern ownership and use of information collected by and through the Services, such information is owned solely by GMA. The information collected by and through the Services may be used by GMA, its divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates, or other entities that are involved in the operation of the Services for GMA’s purposes.
GMA may use the information collected and provided, individually or in an aggregate form, as follows:
to contact you about the Services;
</p>
<p>
to compare and otherwise use data entered by users for any purpose including consulting, research and marketing;
</p>
<p>
to evaluate products and services GMA or third parties could offer to you;
</p>
<p>
to monitor or improve use of the Services;
</p>
<p>
to monitor compliance with GMA’s Terms of Service Agreement of the Services;
</p>
<p>
to provide special offers to you from GMA and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties; and
</p>
<p>
to send you promotional material on behalf of GMA and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties.
</p>
<p>
<h3>3. With Whom Information is Shared</h3>
</p>
<p>
At times, we may share the information collected with the Services with third parties for various purposes. While GMA will seek to require those third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and security measures, GMA does not bear responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others:
User Data: We may share non-Personally Identifiable Information, provided by you through the Services, for any purpose. However, GMA will not, without your prior permission, share such information in a form that allows other members or third parties to link it to any Personally Identifiable Information.
Promotional Offers: Our third party partners and sponsors may contact you with special offers or promotional material. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, and you should review the privacy practices of such third parties prior to providing any of your Personally Identifiable Information to them. If you do not want to receive special offers or promotional materials from GMA or third parties you may contact GMA by using the contact information provided in Section 7 below.
Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as general demographics and Service usage statistics, with third party advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. We do not share specific demographic information.
Business Transfers: The Services, GMA and/or a subsidiary or division of GMA may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur, in which your non-Personally Identifiable Information (i.e., information that is not Personally Identifiable Information) is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, your non-Personally Identifiable Information, which we have gathered, may be one of the business assets we transfer.
Legal Process: GMA reserves the right to disclose the information collected by and through the Services, including your non-Personally Identifiable Information, as required by law and when GMA believes, at its sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary to protect GMA’s rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, subpoena, court order or other legal process served on GMA. The disclosure of this information may be without notice to you.
</p>
<p>
<h3>4. Security and Encryption</h3>
</p>
<p>
While there is no such thing as “perfect security” for information stored on, transmitted or received over the Internet, GMA takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information provided by you. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required. It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure.
</p>
<p>
<h3>5. Third Party Links, Websites, and Cookies</h3>
</p>
<p>
The Services may contain external links to third party websites. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, the content of, or information gathered by these other websites. Any Personally Identifiable Information collected by such third parties is subject to such third parties’ privacy policy. Companies that advertise on the Services do not have access to Personally Identifiable Information that you do not post using any feature of the Services that allows for unilateral or multilateral communication between yourself and other users of the Services. Those advertisers may set their own cookies on your computing devices and access those cookies if you allow them to do so. Third parties’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
<h3>6. Notification of Changes</h3>
</p>
<p>
GMA reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Services. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon availability on the Services. If at any point GMA decides in the future to collect and use Personally Identifiable Information, we may notify you by way of an e-mail or some other means. Your continued use of any of the Services shall constitute your acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy. Since this Privacy Policy may change from time to time, you should review it periodically before you provide any additional Personally Identifiable Information anywhere on the Services.
